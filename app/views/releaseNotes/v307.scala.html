        <h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0.7 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>
                This release has the same functionality as 3.0.6, and should be source compatible with 3.0.6, but
                unlike 3.0.6, is binary compatible with 3.0.5. Please see the <a href="@routes.ReleaseNotes.v306">release notes for 3.0.6</a> to find out
                the details of what the release contains. The goal with this release it to achieve binary compatibility
                with 3.0.5. Unfortunately although 3.0.6 should be source compatible with 3.0.5, it was not binary
                compatible. Also, because 3.0.6 was accidentally not
                binary compatible with 3.0.5, you may need to do a clean build to upgrade from 3.0.6.
