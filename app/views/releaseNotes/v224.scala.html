<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.4 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.4 includes the enhancements listed below. No source code using
ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 2.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than 2.2.0, 2.2.1, or 2.2.4 (with which this release is binary
compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
For information on how to include ScalaTest in your project, see the <a href="/download">download page</a>.
For information on how to use <a href="http://www.scalactic.org/">Scalactic</a> in your production code, see its <a href="http://www.scalactic.org/download">download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: a 2.2.3 release was deployed, but the bug fix it was supposed to include was accidentally left out. Thus 2.2.3 contained no difference from 2.2.2.

<h2>Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added a <code>Chain</code> type that represents a non-empty <code>List</code>, as well as an <code>End</code> object
that can serve as a starting point for expressions like <code>1 :: 2 :: 3 :: End</code>.
</li>
<li>
Added a <code>from</code> method to <code>Or</code>'s companion object that takes an
<code>Option</code> of the <code>Good</code> type and a by-name of the <code>Bad</code> type.
</li>
<li>
Added an <code>OptionSugar</code> trait that provides an implicit conversion that adds a <code>toOr</code> method
to <code>Option</code> that takes a by-name of the <code>Bad</code> type. <code>toOr</code> will convert a
<code>Some</code> to a <code>Good</code> and <code>None</code> to the given <code>Bad</code> value.
</li>
<li>
Added an <code>TrySugar</code> trait that provides an implicit conversion that adds a <code>toOr</code> method
to <code>Try</code>. <code>toOr</code> will convert a
<code>Success</code> to a <code>Good</code> and a <code>Failure</code> to a <code>Bad</code>.
</li>
<li>
Update ScalaCheck dependency to version 1.12.1.
</li>
<li>
Use hard-coded 127.0.0.1 as the host name for the socket reporter when running sbt in fork mode. This
fixed a spurious stack trace annoyance.
</li>
</ul>
