<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.2 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.2 includes the bug fixes listed below. No source code using
ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 2.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than 2.2.0 or 2.2.1 (with which this release is binary
compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
</p>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added <code>_root_</code> to the beginning of all fully qualified names inserted by our macros, to ensure that
a local variable named <code>org</code>, for example, doesn't cause a compiler error when we try to say <code>org.scalactic.</code>.</li>
<li>Ensured that reporter configuration options passed to ScalaTest from sbt with -o (such as -oW) take effect in the output
send to the sbt logger.</li>
<li>Added some missing names to the Osgi bundle.</li>
</ul>
