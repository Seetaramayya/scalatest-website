<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.5 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.5 includes just one change from 2.2.4, a bug fix for the <code>DiagrammedAssertions</code>
macro that was accidentally left out of 2.2.4. No source code using
ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 2.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than other 2.2.x releases (with which this release is binary
compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
